            <h2>MOTIVE</h2>
            <p>
                From a young age I've had a passion for self-expression and art. When I was 
                8 years old I began my journey as a dancer, where I became obsessed with body
                movement. <span>There is something about expressing feelings through art that have
                maintained the harmony in my soul.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                As I grew older, life became harder, and it became difficult to understand who
                I was. I didn't know how to navigate my world alongside humanity. Through 
                heartbreak and pain, mainifested compassion and love. I want to understand humanity. 
                I want to understand you.
            </p>
            <p>
                My fascination with Computer Science,<br>
                in company with my commitment for self-expression,<br>
                close at hand with my benevolence to explain humanity<br>
                has found it's perfect mate . . . UX.

                Welcome to my journey as a designer.
